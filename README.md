# SoleGrid 👟

**SoleGrid** is a modern, responsive sneaker blog inspired by the clean layouts of Nike and GOAT. It showcases articles on sneaker history and culture using semantic HTML5, scalable CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

Articles are rendered dynamically from a local JSON file, giving the site structure and flexibility while keeping it lightweight. Designed with a minimalist aesthetic, the layout adapts fluidly across devices and includes a dark mode toggle for enhanced user preference.
