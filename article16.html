    <p>When Allen Iverson stepped onto the court in the Reebok Question in 1996, a legend was born. The shoe, with its bold toe cap and honeycomb cushioning, became synonymous with Iverson’s fearless style of play and rebellious attitude, capturing the imagination of a generation.</p>
    <p>Beyond the court, the Question Mid became a cultural statement. Iverson’s impact reached far beyond basketball—he blurred the lines between athlete and icon, and his footwear followed suit. The silhouette became a staple in barbershops, music videos, and street fashion almost overnight.</p>
    <p>Years later, the Reebok Question continues to see retro releases and collaborations that honor its heritage. From its Philly-inspired colorways to its leather and suede builds, this sneaker remains a fitting tribute to the player who redefined the game both stylistically and athletically.</p>
