    <p>The New Balance 990 originally debuted in 1982 as one of the most advanced running shoes of its time, boasting a hefty price tag and unparalleled comfort. Over the decades, it evolved from a technical runner into a fashion-forward staple, embraced by dads, normcore fans, and celebrities alike.</p>
    <p>Its transformation into a ‘cool dad shoe’ happened organically, thanks to its premium build quality, Made in USA craftsmanship, and no-frills aesthetic. From Silicon Valley entrepreneurs to supermodels off-duty, the 990 has become a surprising symbol of understated luxury and everyday wearability.</p>
    <p>Now in its sixth iteration, the 990 continues to dominate. Each version retains the essence of the original while incorporating new tech and design cues. It's a masterclass in evolution—proof that practicality and style don’t have to be mutually exclusive in the sneaker world.</p>
